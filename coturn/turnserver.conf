# TURN listener port for TLS (Default: 5349).
# Note: actually, "plain" TCP & UDP sessions can connect to the TLS & DTLS
# port(s), too - if allowed by configuration. The TURN server
# "automatically" recognizes the type of traffic. Actually, two listening
# endpoints (the "plain" one and the "tls" one) are equivalent in terms of
# functionality; but Coturn keeps both endpoints to satisfy the RFC 5766 specs.
# For secure TCP connections, Coturn currently supports SSL version 3 and
# TLS version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.
# For secure UDP connections, Coturn supports DTLS version 1.
